        <p>This is Mamamoos first album. When they came out with this album, it was super diffrent then other girlgroups that where already around. They had a jazzy/ soul vibe to them and people were liking it. A lot of diffrent artist that were already in the industry for a long gave them a shoutout on shows or on live streams aspesaly when the question was "what is your favorite song these days" and their answar would be Mr ambigouos by Mamamoo.</p>
